# Git Definitions

**Instructions: ** Define each of the following Git concepts.

* What is version control?  Why is it useful?
Version control allows code to evolve with abandon. And if something doesn't work, a easy way to go back. I honestly didn't think programmers used this because everytime my favorite app changed they never changed it back. But this allows you to edit code knowing that if the edits doesn't work you can revert your change.
* What is a branch and why would you use one?
Sometimes you want to try to add different things at the same time. I could see this being useful when working on a team. That way the same code can be edited by two people wihtout each others work popping up infront of each other. Then when everyone is ready to submit their code you can merge each other's branches.
* What is a commit? What makes a good commit message?
A commit message is a signpost, this is what I am gonna do. So a good commit message should be understood by more than just the peroson who wrote it.
* What is a merge conflict?
When the merge isn't compatible? Kinda lost on this one still as I haven't experienced it myself. But i assume that 2 branches that either changed the same thing can then work together.
